# Martian-Token-Crowdsale

## Background
After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected me to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose me to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token thatâ€™s ERC-20 compliant. I have launched a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

## Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract (Evaluation Evidence)
First I have compiled the `KaseiCoin Token` contract.

I have compiled the `KaseiCoin Crowdsale` contract.

I have also compiled the `KaseiCoin Deployer` contract.

Next, I deployed the `KaseiCoin Deployer` contract.

I then opened the deployed `KaseiCoin Deployer` contract, here you can see the two addresses for the `KaseiCoin Crowdsale` and the `KaseiCoin Token` contract.

As the contracts have been deployed, I used the `At Address` function to interact with the `KaseiCoin Crowdsale` and the `KaseiCoin Token` contract.

These are the functions in the `KaseiCoin Crowdsale` contract:

## Interact with The Deployed Smart Contract
To test the functionality of the crowdsale until this step, I used some test accounts to buy new tokens and then checking the balances of those accounts.

Up to this step, because we have not finalised the crowdsale, hence only the gas fee was deducted from the account. We can see the account balance has dropped slightly:

And this transaction can be varified in Ganache:
